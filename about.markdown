## Coding Club Blogs

Welcome to Coding Club Blogs, the platform where coding enthusiasts converge to share their knowledge, insights, and experiences. We are dedicated to fostering a vibrant coding community.

### Mission

At Coding Club Blogs, our mission is to create a space for collaborative learning and knowledge sharing in the field of programming. We believe in the power of community-driven education and aim to provide a platform for individuals to contribute their unique perspectives and expertise.

For a broader view of our coding club's activities and initiatives, please visit our main [coding club website](https://sdgniser.github.io/).

### Call for Articles and Talks

#### Giving a Talk

If you have a passion for a particular programming topic and would like to share your insights with the community, we welcome you to give a talk! Please reach out to us at [code@niser.ac.in](mailto:code@niser.ac.in) with your proposed topic.

Before the talk, we kindly ask you to provide a brief document outlining the topics you plan to cover, akin to an abstract. Following the talk, we also request that you submit a written documentation of the topics discussed, preferably in Markdown format. This documentation will be hosted as a blog post here on Coding Club Blogs.


#### Writing a Blog

Not interested in giving a talk but still want to share your thoughts or knowledge? You're welcome to contribute a written blog post, preferably in Markdown format. Contact us at [code@niser.ac.in](mailto:code@niser.ac.in) to discuss your ideas and get started.

We believe in the diversity of voices, and whether through talks or blogs, we look forward to showcasing the richness of programming perspectives within our community.

Happy coding!

NISER Coding Club
