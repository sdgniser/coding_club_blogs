In our recent Code n Coffee session on August 17th, we explored the powerful plotting capabilities of `matplotlib`, a popular plotting library in Python. This post will walk you through the functions and concepts we covered during the session.

## Setting Up the Environment

To start with, we imported the necessary libraries:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from pandas import read_csv
```

- **`matplotlib.pyplot`**: The main plotting module in Matplotlib.
- **`numpy`**: A library for numerical operations in Python, often used for handling arrays.
- **`pandas`**: Used here to read the CSV data files containing our data.

We also set up the plotting environment by reading in the data from two CSV files:

```python
data1 = read_csv('/content/line_reg1.csv')
data2 = read_csv('/content/line_reg2.csv')
x = data1['vi']
y = data1['vo']
x2 = data2['vi']
y2 = data2['vo']
```

- **`read_csv`**: A function from Pandas to load data from a CSV file into a DataFrame.
- `x`, `y`, `x2`, `y2` are arrays containing the data points for plotting.

## Plotting the Data

We then plotted the data using `plt.plot()`:

```python
plt.plot(x, y, '--o', label='data1')
plt.plot(x2, y2, '-*', label='data2')
plt.xlabel("$V_i$")
plt.ylabel("$V_o$")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

- **`plt.plot()`**: This function plots the data points on a 2D graph. The first argument is the x-axis data, and the second is the y-axis data.
  - The style `--o` indicates a dashed line with circle markers for `data1`.
  - The style `-*` indicates a solid line with star markers for `data2`.
- **`plt.xlabel()`** and **`plt.ylabel()`**: These functions label the x and y axes. We used LaTeX syntax (`$...$`) to include mathematical symbols in the labels.
- **`plt.legend()`**: Adds a legend to differentiate between the plotted data.
- **`plt.show()`**: Displays the plot.

## Fitting a Polynomial to the Data

Next, we demonstrated how to fit a polynomial to the data and plot the best-fit curve:

```python
fit = np.polyfit(x2, y2, 3)
print(fit)
x_fit = np.linspace(6, 18, 100)
y_fit = np.polyval(fit, x_fit)
plt.plot(x2, y2, 'o', label="actual data")
plt.plot(x_fit, y_fit, '--', label="Best fit")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

- **`np.polyfit(x, y, degree)`**: This function fits a polynomial of the specified degree (3 in this case) to the data.
- **`np.linspace(start, stop, num)`**: Generates `num` evenly spaced points between `start` and `stop`. We used this to create a smooth curve for the best-fit line.
- **`np.polyval(fit, x_fit)`**: Evaluates the polynomial `fit` at each point in `x_fit` to produce the corresponding `y` values.
- The second `plt.plot()` command is used to plot both the actual data and the fitted polynomial curve.

## Conclusion

This session gave us a strong foundation in using `matplotlib` for data visualization. We learned how to:
- Plot basic data with different styles.
- Label axes and add legends.
- Fit a polynomial to data and visualize the fit.

Feel free to experiment with different data and plotting styles to further enhance your visualization skills!
