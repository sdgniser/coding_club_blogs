# Coding Club Blogs - Jekyll Blog Site

## Welcome to Coding Club Blogs Repository

This repository houses the source code for the Coding Club Blogs, a Jekyll-powered blog site dedicated to creating a space for coding enthusiasts to share their knowledge, insights, and experiences. Whether you're here to explore, contribute, or set up your own instance, we're thrilled to have you!


## Contributing 

### Giving a Talk

If you're interested in giving a talk, please reach out to us at code@niser.ac.in with your proposed topic. Provide a brief document outlining the topics you plan to cover, similar to an abstract. After the talk, submit a written documentation of the topics discussed, preferably in Markdown format. This documentation will be hosted as a blog post on the Coding Club Blogs.

### Writing a Blog

Not keen on giving a talk but still want to share your thoughts or knowledge? Youâ€™re welcome to contribute a written blog post. Reach out to us at code@niser.ac.in to discuss your ideas and get started.
Mission

Our mission is to foster a vibrant coding community by creating a platform for collaborative learning and knowledge sharing in the field of programming.


### Math and Interactive Plots

For future users who write blogs, the MathJax and Plotly scripts have been added already for inline math and interactive plots. You can use MathJax to include mathematical notation in your posts and Plotly to create interactive plots.

#### Example Usage

**MathJax:** To include inline math, use `$...$` for inline math or `$$...$$` for display math.

```markdown
Inline math: $E = mc^2$
Display math:
$$
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
$$
